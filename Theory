 #   Data structures:
        Arrays: An array is a data structure that stores data in a linear fashion.
        Linked lists: A linked list is a data structure that stores data in a non-linear fashion.
        Stacks: A stack is a data structure that stores data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) fashion.
        Queues: A queue is a data structure that stores data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) fashion.
        Trees: A tree is a data structure that stores data in a hierarchical fashion.
        Graphs: A graph is a data structure that stores data in a network fashion.

#    Algorithms:
        Searching algorithms: A searching algorithm is a procedure for finding a specific item in a data structure.
        Sorting algorithms: A sorting algorithm is a procedure for ordering the elements of a data structure.
        Divide and conquer algorithms: A divide and conquer algorithm is a recursive algorithm that breaks a problem down into smaller subproblems.
        Greedy algorithms: A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step.
        Recursion: Recursion is a programming technique that calls itself to solve a problem.
        Backtracking: Backtracking is a recursive algorithm that tries all possible solutions to a problem.
        Dynamic programming: Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of the subproblems.
